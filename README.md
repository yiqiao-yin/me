- 👋 Hi, I’m @yiqiao-yin
- 👀 I’m interested in developing AI-bsed methods to test the conjecture that the success of machine learning algorithms generally depends on data representation, which is a family of higher form of undersatnding both academically and pragmatically desired, because different representations can entangle and hide more or less the different explanatory factors of variation behind the data.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on developing deep expertise in data science, analytics, and oncology clinical domain knowledge to provide innovative, data-driven strategies for clients in the life sciences industry across all phases of product development and commercialization.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on computer vision related tasks.

I was a PhD student in Statistics at Columbia University from September of 2020 to December of 2021. I had a B.A. in Mathematics, and an M.S. in Finance from University of Rochester. I have a wide range of research interests in representation learning: Feature Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision (CV), and Natural Language Processing (NLP).

I am currently a Senior Data Scientist at an S&P 500 company LabCorp, developing AI-driven solutions for drug diagnostics, drug development, and financial decisions (see Labcorp SEC filings here). Prior, I have held professional positions such as enterprise-level Data Scientist at a EURO STOXX 50 company Bayer, quantitative researcher at AQR working on alternative quantitative strategies to portfolio management and factor-based trading, and equity trader at T3 Trading on Wall Street. I supervise a small fund specializing in algorithmic trading (since 2011, performance is here) and real estate investment. I also run my own monetarized YouTube Channel.
